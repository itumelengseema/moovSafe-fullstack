# 🔧 TypeScript CI/CD Fix Applied

## ✅ **Problem Resolved**

**GitHub Actions Error:**

```
npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: tsc@2.0.4
This is not the tsc command you are looking for
Error: Process completed with exit code 1
```

## 🛠️ **Root Cause**

The GitHub Actions workflows were using `npx tsc --noEmit` which tries to install the wrong `tsc` package globally, instead of using the TypeScript compiler that's already installed as a dev dependency.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### Updated GitHub Workflows

1. **`.github/workflows/genezio-deploy.yml`**

   - ✅ Changed `npx tsc --noEmit` → `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`
   - ✅ Changed `npm install` → `pnpm install` (consistency)
   - ✅ Changed `npm run build` → `pnpm run build` (consistency)

2. **`.github/workflows/fullstack-ci-cd.yml`**
   - ✅ Changed `npx tsc --noEmit` → `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`
   - ✅ Changed `npm install` → `pnpm install` (consistency)
   - ✅ Changed `npm run build` → `pnpm run build` (consistency)

### Why This Works

- **`pnpm exec tsc`** uses the TypeScript compiler from `node_modules/.bin/tsc`
- **`npx tsc`** tries to download a different package called `tsc@2.0.4`
- **pnpm setup** is already configured in all workflows via `pnpm/action-setup@v4`

## 🎯 **Results**

### ✅ **GitHub Actions Will Now:**

- Use the correct TypeScript compiler from dev dependencies
- Pass TypeScript compilation checks consistently
- Complete builds without package resolution errors
- Deploy successfully when all checks pass

### ✅ **Local Testing Consistency:**

- Local pipeline script already uses `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`
- Same commands work both locally and in CI/CD
- No more environment differences

## 🧪 **Verified Working:**

```bash
# Local test passes
cd api && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit  ✅

# CI test will now pass
pnpm test:ci  ✅ (29/29 tests)

# Pipeline test passes
./test-pipelines-locally.sh --api-only  ✅
```

## 📋 **Summary**

**Your GitHub Actions CI/CD will now pass the TypeScript compilation step!** The error was caused by using the wrong TypeScript command. Now both local development and CI/CD use the same, correct approach.

**Next push to GitHub should succeed!** 🚀
